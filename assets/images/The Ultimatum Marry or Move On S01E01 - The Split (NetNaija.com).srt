00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:21,062
I knew Hunter was the one for me
when we went on our first trip.

3
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,774
He was so patient,
just let me run the show.

4
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,026
Eyes on the prize, right?

5
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,278
[both chuckle]

[camera shutter clicking]

7
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,867
I initiated the conversation
with Hunter about an ultimatum.

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,786
<i>I'm ready to make the next step.</i>

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,459
And I basically told Hunter,
"We either get engaged or we break up."

10
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,086
[upbeat music playing]

11
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,091
-Guys, come on in. Grab a seat.
-Welcome. Hey.

12
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,428
[Hunter]<i> I do believe that</i>
<i>we're at a stage in our relationship,</i>

13
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:57,766
and I'm at a stage in my life,
where I can answer that question for us.

14
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,893
But you're not ready
to answer the question.

15
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,353
Because-- or else
you would've already answered it.

16
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,521
Okay, that's fair.

17
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,815
But-- Okay.

18
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,277
[Alexis]<i> I want what I want,</i>
<i>and that's a ring.</i>

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,654
At the end of this,
I will have an answer for you.

20
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,864
One way or another.

We met in college.

23
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,207
I was working at a bar.

24
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,335
She comes walking through the doors.
As soon as I saw her, I was like,

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,921
blown away. I knew she was the one.

[Colby] I'm ready for marriage.

32
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:45,230
I'm 100% in.
I'm ready to propose to Madlyn.

33
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,983
I just wanna be known as her man.

34
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,485
-[Madlyn] Hi!
-Come on in.

35
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,402
Hi, guys!

36
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,987
Hi, I'm Madlyn.

37
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,114
[Madlyn]<i> I love him.</i>

38
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,450
He's ready for me to choose him.

39
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,495
But I'm not ready to get married yet.

40
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,290
<i>Choosing one person</i>
<i>for the rest of your life,</i>

41
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,167
that's a pretty big choice.

42
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:11,422
<i>I don't really believe in there</i>
<i>only being one person for everybody.</i>

43
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:16,344
Do I think that there's a possibility that
I could be happy with somebody else? Yes.

44
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,638
<i>I think it's natural</i>
<i>to wonder what it would be like</i>

45
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,306
<i>to be in a different relationship.</i>

46
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,893
That's why I'm giving
my girlfriend an ultimatum.

[pop music playing]

48
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:32,902
It's-- It's an ultimatum to either--
You know, she marries me or…

49
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,072
I'm moving on, and…

50
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:42,412
I am worth her whole heart.

51
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,081
And if she can't see that,

52
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,542
I need to find somebody else who can.

[romantic music playing]

54

[Colby]<i> The scariest part</i>

is potentially losing her.

56

And…

57
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,772
<i>I would be crushed if she walked</i>
<i>out of here with another guy.</i>

58
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:14,444
But there's got to be somebody out there
looking for what I'm looking for,

59
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,695
and that's love.

61
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,165
Well, hello, everybody.

62
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:31,002
You're here because someone
in your relationship has issued

63
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,378
an ultimatum.

66
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,391
I'm Nick Lachey.

I am Vanessa Lachey.

68
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:51,022
In your relationships,
one partner is ready to get married,

69
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,524
and the other isn't quite as sure.

70
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:58,780
So, Shanique, you issued
the ultimatum to Randall.

71
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,115
He's a little comfortable
going with the flow.

72
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,576
I want to make sure that
we're planning to build together

73
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,787
in a way that includes marriage.

74
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,540
[Shanique]<i> I've shown a lot</i>
<i>of qualities in my relationship</i>

75
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,125

<i>I don't mind cooking,</i>

77
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,714

I don't like doing dishes. [chuckles]

78
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,008
I'm ready for my first baby.

79
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,803
Then I'm gonna have to have another baby
a couple years after that.

<i>You help with the cleaning,</i>
<i>and I will do my best with the kids.</i>

81

I want a ring on this finger.

82
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,978
You're ready
'cause you issued the ultimatum, right?

83
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,563
I do, yeah. And I think he is too,
he just doesn't know.

[all chuckle]

85
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,694
[Randall] I think it'd be best to just
be able to get rid of some debt

86
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,112
that I have in my past,

87
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,698
um, in order to have a great life for her.

88
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,116
That's ultimately my reason,

89
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,867
-but she doesn't understand.
-[Nick] Okay.

90
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,578
I don't want to think about
if Shanique will leave me, if

91
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,331
I decide not to marry her right now.

92
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,418
<i>She feels like she's ready for marriage.</i>

93
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:57,547
<i>And I have honestly</i>
<i>turned that down more times than not,</i>

94
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,923
because I know that I'm not.

95
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,467
And I know that--
Honestly, I don't think she is.

96
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:05,388
<i>Marriage in her mind is just</i>
<i>a huge wedding, just super flashy.</i>

97
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,849
<i>She's a spender, and I feel like</i>
<i>that kinda has to be broken</i>

98
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,810
<i>before you bring kids in,</i>
<i>before you want to have a marriage,</i>

99
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:15,481
and join a life with somebody
who is very financially conscious.

100
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,275
[Nick] Let's be honest.

101
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:21,696
Fear of commitment almost always
boils down to the exact same question.

102
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,365
Is there someone else out there
who might be a better fit?

103
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,701
[dramatic music playing]

104
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,787
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

105
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,999
You're each gonna experience
two different visions

106
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,418
of what your married life could be.

107
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,463
Take a good look around at each other.

108
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:44,802
Each of you are compatible
with multiple different partners.

109
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:49,265
And you are all thinking about marriage
in a really, really intensive way.

110
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,102
[Vanessa] You're gonna find out
if there are people here,

111
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,689
other than the person you're with,
that actually could be a fit for you.

112
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,027
As potential mates.
As potential marriage material.

113
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,821
[Nick] If you're not sure
you wanna marry your current partner,

114
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,991
the risk is that
they're gonna find someone else who is.

115
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:11,371
[Hunter] <i>Being surrounded by other men</i>
<i>and women who have been issued ultimatums,</i>

<i>there's some value here.</i>

117
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,334
I'm going to get the opportunity to talk
to other couples in a similar situation.

118
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:20,004
I'm also going to discover if
I am really connecting with someone.

119
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,882
In order to give Alexis,
you know, an answer to the ultimatum,

120
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,842
I need to answer those questions.

121
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,638
<i>I'm not ready to propose to Alexis</i>
<i>at this moment.</i>

122
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,473
But if I met the perfect person,

123
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,185
I would be ready to be engaged tomorrow.

124
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,353
[Nick] Psychologists agree

125
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,898
an ultimatum is not a good way
to get somebody else to do what you want.

126
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:42,026
But it is the best way
to get you the answers you need

127
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,611
on a timetable you can live with.

128
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,529
I like that.

129
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,906
I always said I was gonna be that girl
that would never

130
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,409
give a man an ultimatum, and it was--

131
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,452
-I was 29 and I was like--
-She was lying. She--

132
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,163
[Vanessa] No.
Five years later, things changed.

133
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,957
-But look what it got me!
-Hey!

134
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,751
-[all chuckle]
-[Vanessa] We dated for five years.

135
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,878
So I finally said, "What are we doing?"

136
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:05,007
I have now moved in with him.
I renovated his entire bachelor pad.

137
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,635
There was a bar in the pool.
I'm like, "Whatever you want."

138
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,262
Now I want kids in the pool.

139
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,513
[laughing]

140
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,641
-So that's when I started the dance.
-That's what put the nail in the coffin.

141
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,685
You see that ring? It looks good.

-[laughing]

144
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,982

[laughing]

146
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,735
So since you won't do it.
I'm just kidding.

147
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,279
[all laughing]

148
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,780
[Vanessa] We actually--

149
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,576
If I'm being completely candid
and transparent, we took a break.

150
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,370
We both saw one other person.

151
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,706
And we realized that

152
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,668
if we got out of our own way,
we could be amazing together.

153
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,462
But it took seeing somebody else,

154
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:46,382
and me realizing I don't mind the things
I thought bugged me or held me back.

155
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,592
I don't mind all that.

156
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,927
The bigger picture
is how I feel about this person,

157
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,723
and their values of wanting to be with me,
and knowing everything about me.

158
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,683
I think we got perspective.

159
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,188
So tonight is your last night
together as a couple.

160
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,359
At the end of the week,
you'll each choose a new partner.

161
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:11,616
You'll move in together
for three weeks in a trial marriage.

162
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,039
Then you're gonna go
through exactly the same experience

163
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,124
with the person you arrived here with.

164

[April] <i>Seeing the other five women</i>
<i>that Jake's gonna date,</i>

to grab Jake's hand and run.

…but it is a little bit nerve-racking.

168
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,851
During this entire experience,
ask the important questions,

169
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,729
and have the most difficult conversations
that people should have

170
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,231
prior to getting married.

171
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,900
Many of you are gonna feel
like you're falling in love.

172
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,903
Some of you may find yourself
in love with two people.

173
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,406
And that could seem confusing
or even overwhelming.

174
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,284
And let me tell you, it will be.

175
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,578
But that's the whole point.

176
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,289
Absence can make the heart grow fonder.

177
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,042
Or absence can make the heart grow absent.

178
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,045
And the choice you'll each make
at the end of this process,

179
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,672
it shouldn't be an easy one.

-[Vanessa] At the end of this experience--
-[Nick] The ultimatum will come to term,

181
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,719
and you guys will have to choose.

182
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,389
Either to marry
the person you've arrived here with

183
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,057
or to split forever.

184
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,602
[Vanessa] Or is there someone new
that's a better fit?

185
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:25,523
They're strangers now, but you could
be looking at your future husband or wife.

186
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,567
Anyone from the other couples

187
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,361
might turn out to be exactly
what you're looking for.

188
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,323
We want all of you to leave here

189
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:39,912
engaged to the person you know you want
to spend the rest of your life with.

190
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,081
The right person for you to marry.

[Randall] <i>People--</i>

00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,362
Um,

202
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,823

215
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:05,164

We have six other couples here

[April] We talked about
getting married from the jump.

245
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:32,084
Do you understand the stuff we invested in
each other are stuff husband and wife do?

246
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,919
-Yes.
-We're not husband and wife.

247
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,504
You bought me a car.

I just don't understand,
if we're not married,

249

-why would you buy me a car?
-'Cause I care about you.

-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-…second and third row, did I not?

What did you tell the dealership?
"She wants her mom car."

Mm-hmm.

00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:53,439
I'm driving this big-ass SUV with nobody
in the back seat, except myself.

00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,566
Have I done anything to prevent that?

-No.
-No.

257
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,652
I've literally dropped everything.

Like, given up everything I'm passionate
about to make sure you're happy.

259
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,576
It's just-- I just got out
of the military a year ago.

260
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,411
I want to travel. I want to have fun.

261
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,246
I want to be financially stable.

262
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,999
I know that
you just got out of the military.

263
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,168
But you've been out for what?
A year and a half?

264
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,046
Before you got out, we almost eloped.

265
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,965
We were in love with each other.
Like, "This is what we want to do."

266
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:20,883
I still am.

267
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,093
I feel like
I have been very, very patient.

268
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,678
What are your reserves?

269
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:28,057
'Cause it can't just be your timeline
or wanting to be financially stable.

270
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,186
I'm hoping, with this experience,
I can date around.

from another perspective.

Do-- do I love you? Yes.

275
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,701
I-- I really do love you, 100%.

276
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,454
I've never had
this feeling with anybody else.

277
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,706
I see me being with you
for the rest of my life.

278
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,500
I think that's why it hurts,

279
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,710
cause I feel like I'm ready
and you're not.

280
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:02,800
I'm not going through another
three-year relationship to end in nothing.

281
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,677
That is why I'm giving this ultimatum.

282
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,264
I love you to death,
but I just cannot wait any longer.

283
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,767
And if you don't have that clarity
by the end of this experiment…

284
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,978
I will be done.

[Jake] I wanna be with you
more than anything.

I want you to be the mother of my kids.
I want you to be my wife.

288

It's just I want us
to both be on the same page.

289
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:31,161
And I hope at the end of the experience,
I'll be on one knee proposing to you.

290
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,664
-That would make me really happy.
-I know it would.

[pop music playing]

292
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,973
I know for a fact
I love you more than anything.

293
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,393
But there are some things
that we can't get past.

294
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,354
Like the kid thing.

295
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,734
I believe in compromise in a relationship.
I don't believe in sacrifice.

296
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,238
And I don't want
to think of children as a sacrifice.

297
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,199
I want to think of it as like--

298
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:13,829
But if you don't want to have kids,
and I'm saying I do want to have kids,

299
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,708
then, okay, we're compromising
and we're gonna have a half kid?

300
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,043
-No, I--
-You know what I mean?

301
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,587
You're saying
we shouldn't have sacrifices, though.

302
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,131
-No, what I'm trying to say--
-Relationships should.

303
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,716
Are you gonna let me freaking talk?

304
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:31,805
My name is Lauren, and my boyfriend
Nathan is giving me an ultimatum.

<i>I don't want children.</i>

306
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:38,062
I feel kind of awkward
interacting with children sometimes.

307
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:42,024
I'm just-- I don't know.
It's something that I've never really felt

308
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,318
needed to be a part of my life.

309
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:49,573
I think that ultimately you should
be with somebody who shares

310
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,660
similar wants and needs in life as you.

311
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:57,247
I don't think that anybody should have
to sacrifice anything for another person.

312
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,292
<i>And Nathan definitely knows where I stand</i>

313
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,878
when it comes to
how I feel about children.

314
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:08,217
If we can't come to that agreement,
then ultimately we will have to break up.

315
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:13,055
[sighs] I want to get clarity from this.
Like, that's the point. Like,

316
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,433
I'm here to find clarity
for our relationship.

317
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:20,980
And figure out, like, "Hey,
is this something that we can move past?"

318
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,608
"Or is this something, like,
this probably just isn't right?" And…

319
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:30,114
You need to find someone
who can agree to have children with you.

320
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,367
Mm-hmm. I agree.

321
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,536
I want to get married.

322
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,583
Anyone that I would think
about marriage with, especially Lauren,

323
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,379
<i>would have to be willing to have children</i>
<i>and to grow a family together.</i>

324

If Lauren's not ready to marry me,

325
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,676
then I'm absolutely
going to find someone that-- that is.

00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,738
-Cheers to our last night together.
-Cheers to our last night together.

331
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,450
My name is Rae,
I'm giving my boyfriend Zay an ultimatum.

332
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,702
<i>We have dated through college.</i>

333
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:20,289
And I have graduated
and I have everything planned in my life.

334
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,709
My next steps. My next career move.
Just-- Isn't that how it goes, you know?

335
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:27,171
College, then proposal, then babies, then

336
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,298
honeymoon in Cancun.

337
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,009
-I can't even eat. I'm so nervous.
-What are you nervous for?

338
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,803
Just I can't picture myself
with anybody else besides you.

339
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,765
Zay has the full package with me

340
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,893
because I stay in the gym,
I have a degree,

341
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,936
I cook, I clean, and I know how to fuck.

342
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,814
I don't think he's gonna find that
with these other girls.

343
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,068
[whispering] Can I say "fuck"?

344
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,488
So what is one thing
that you want to get out of

345
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,408
hanging with
and spending time with different guys?

346
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,036
I might try to find somebody
who's the opposite of you,

347
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,579
and just kind of see how that goes.

348
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,122
-Hmm.
-I don't know.

349
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,416
-How do you--
-We'll see who we click with.

350
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,959
How do you think that will help you?

351
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,837
Maybe just seeing if the grass is greener

352
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,757
and reminding me the qualities
that I really do love about you.

353
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,968
Why would you pick somebody
the opposite of me? And you're trying to--

354
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,304
You're trying to make it work with me.

355
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,264
I thought the whole point
of this experiment,

356
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,184
was to just, like,
date somebody different.

357
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,895
And then come back
to our original, like, pairing.

358
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,313
Right?

359
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:31,485
I mean, the experience to me
is to see who the person I want to marry.

360
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,862
That's why you are picking
who you're dating.

361
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,364
-Mm-hmm.
-Not me.

362
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,867
We came here as a couple,
but at the end of the day, it's

363
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,871
-about figuring out what's best for us…
-Mm-hmm.

364
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,541
…as individual people,
you know what I'm saying?

365
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:49,211
If Zay's not ready to take that next step,
and start our family and our careers,

366
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,089
and move into this next part of our lives,
I'll have to move on.

367
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,008
I would be sad to start over,
but I'm not scared to start over.

368
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,261
I think that
there is someone for everyone,

369
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,597
and I think that a lot of people
would be happy to be with me.

370
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,641
I want to make it work with you.

371
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:07,479
You're the woman that I want to have
my kids and to live and grow old with.

372
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:11,275
If I don't leave here with you, I just--
I don't know. I feel like I would…

373
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,192
[sighs]

374
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,735
…just lose everything I've been--

375
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,571
All we put in
the last two and a half years.

376
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,531
And I think our friends and family
would be sad

377
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,075
if we didn't walk out
of this experience together.

378
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,997
Well, it's kinda hard to think about.

379
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:31,211
Rae just graduated from college,
and I'm still, you know, um,

380
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,254
trying to graduate.

381
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,839
Like, both of us want kids.

382
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:37,009
Both of us want to get married,
but the problem is,

383
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:41,638
this honestly feels like
my first, you know, real relationship.

384
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,183
We're both still
trying to figure things out.

385
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,977
We can't rush getting into a marriage.

386
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,980
I mean, you're everything to me, like--

387
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:54,234
like you changed me
in a-- in a lot of ways.

388
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:59,364
You help me to understand, like,
things just that I didn't understand…

389
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,407
Mmm.

390
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,658
…about life.

391
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:06,705
You show me, like,
love I've just never had before.

392
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,625
I don't know.
You're everything to me, and I would--

393
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,418
-I mean, I would hate to lose you.
-Yeah.

394
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,170
I just hope that,

395
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:18,091
and wish that we come out
of this experience together.

396
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,018
I hope that the connections
that you make ultimately help us,

397
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,270
and that we walk out of here engaged.

398
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,815
That's my goal for this experience
but, I mean, we'll see how it goes.

399
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,527
I just-- I want to know more about, like,

400
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,906
how you actually feel about me, you know?

401
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,408
I see you being my husband,

402
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:47,204
and I hope that this experience shows you
that you want me to be your wife.

403
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,458
Okay. Okay, Rae.

404
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,337
I mean, when it comes to you,
I can talk about you forever,

405
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,755
and tell you exactly how I feel.

406
00:20:56,838 --> 00:21:00,175
And when it's with you,
it's just like super closed off.

407
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,011
-You know?
-Because I'm afraid of being hurt.

408
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,055
-But that is--
-Opening up to other people.

409
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,642
Okay, and if you're emotional,
and you feel some type of way,

410
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,353
this is what I'm here for.
This- That's why I'm your man, right?

411
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,731
When you're emotional and wanna talk
to somebody, you can talk to me.

412
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,692
That's what I'm here for.

413
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,529
Tomorrow, you'll be dating other guys,
and they'll be like, "Oh how do you feel?"

414
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,406
Are you gonna-- are you gonna spill
to them?

415
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,742
Or you just-- Or you just gonna be
shut off to everybody else too?

416
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,578
Well, I guess
that's something that I have to work on.

417
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,165
I guess that's why we're here.
'Cause we have stuff we need to work on.

418
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,085
[woman] Can you explain why you love Zay?

419
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,839
And why you think he's somebody that you,
coming into this, want to marry?

420
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,133
Um…

421
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,974
I think…

422
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,648
I don't know. Can we skip that question
and come back? Or is that the last one?

423
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:03,238
I'm stressed out that
you're gonna end up liking somebody else.

424
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:07,326
And I'm asking you to talk to me about
how you feel, and you can't say anything.

425
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,828
But you're stressed out
about me liking somebody else?

426
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,416
You got to let me know
when that makes sense to you.

427
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,752
I mean, that don't--
That don't make sense to me.

428
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,588
I feel like I gave you the ultimatum.

429
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,508
-Like-- No, like, for real. I'm serious.
-[chuckles]

430
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:28,764
I want you to be emotional. I want you
to pour out exactly how you feel about me.

431
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,683
But if it's only,
"I care about him, he knows that."

432
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:35,854
If that is the energy from somebody
that wants to be with me and,

433
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:39,483
you know, spend the rest-- the rest
of their life with me,

434
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,526
I don't-- I mean, I don't know if that's--

435
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,528
that's the correct energy to come by.

436
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,739
I mean, I'm the one issuing the ultimatum.

437
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,158
-Exactly. And I'm--
-So I feel like that can push you away.

438
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,118
And that's fine.
You're issuing the ultimatum.

439
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,622
I should be the person
over here shaking in my boots.

440
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:58,960
You're saying, "If you're not ready
to put a ring on my finger, I'm leaving."

441
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:00,837
But

442
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,632
you're-- you're supposed
to be the worried one?

443
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,802
This is our last night together for--

444
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:10,931
I can show you better than I can tell you.
I'm just gonna leave it at that.

445
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,728
You just-- I mean, you just--

446
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,855
That's how I'm feeling right now, so…

447
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,399
[scoffs] All right.

448
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,860
I mean, it is crazy to me
that she gave me an ultimatum,

449
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:28,240
and she can't tell me,
you know, how-- how she feels about me.

450
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,245
<i>I can't believe this is reality.</i>

451
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,581
And this is our last night together,

452
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,793
and it can potentially
change our-- our lives forever.

453
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,962
[upbeat music playing]

454
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,931
-[Shanique] You gotta take these off.
-Oh, yeah. I got you. I got you.

455
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,475
[pop music playing]

456
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,566
[Shanique] I love you so much.

457
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,529
What are you most excited for?
I gotta ask you.

458
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,658
I don't know,
not being nagged all the time or--

459
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:12,993
-[screams]
-I'm just kidding.

460
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,287
-You know I love you.
-I love you too.

461
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,791
[Randall]<i> I'm not ready</i>
<i>to say goodbye to Shanique.</i>

462
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,419
But I didn't issue the ultimatum.

463
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,755
I wasn't the one that wanted
to go through this experience.

464
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,550
I'll be dating other people
during this ultimatum.

465
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:33,221
I'm hoping that she understands
what she has at stake.

466
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,689
We're literally, like,
breaking up at this point.

467
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:47,277
Like, this is the last time
that we're officially a couple, so…

468
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,947
That's really, like,
messing with me right now.

469
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:55,410
Regardless of what may happen,
regardless of things that we go through,

470
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,537
I really mean
when I say that I really love you.

471
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,082
-Don't cry.
-No.

472
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,542
[sad music playing]

473
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,170
Come here. Give me a hug. Come here.

474
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,882
It's okay.

475
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,677
It's okay.

476
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,887
[sobbing]

477
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,141
Hey. Don't cry. Stop. Stop.

478
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,520
Look at me. Look at me. Come on.

479
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,856
You're grabbing my neck. Okay. Come on.

480
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,069
You know I love you, right?

481
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,154
Hey.

482
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:39,246
Maybe this is the thing that will propel
us into new heights in this relationship.

483
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,832
I know you want to get married right away,
but what if you do come out of this,

484
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,253
saying that, "Maybe Randall was right,"
or, "Maybe we should just, you know,

485
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,088
take it easy and just wait."

486
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,466
That's why we have
to go in there open-minded.

487
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,885
I know a lot can change within a month.

488
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,179
You scared?

489
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:01,810
I mean, I know I brought you into this,
and so I just don't want to regret it.

490
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,146
I realize that I am the one
who asked him to come here.

491
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,692
And now I'm allowing him
to walk out of my hotel room

492
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,068
<i>as a single man.</i>

493
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,070
<i>That-- That is just</i>

494
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,700
the craziest thing. Like, it's crazy.

495
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,869
-[April] Does that hurt?
-[Jake] Mm-mmm.

496
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,622
Who's gonna do this for you when I leave?

497
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,208
Nobody, not as good as you do it.

498
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,920
I want to go back to sleep with my man.
Like, I do not want to be here.

499
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,548
This does not feel good.
I feel like he's back in the military.

500
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,633
He's, like, getting deployed
and I have to say bye.

501
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,551
You got a masseuse.

502
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,761
Unless I find somebody else that…

503
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:37,679
Oh, good luck.

504
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,972
…knows how to do it.

505
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:43,560
You're very in a vulnerable
position right now. I'd be very careful.

506
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:47,063
It's even worse because he's gonna go out
and he's gonna be dating five girls a day.

507
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,441
So, not a good feeling at all.

508
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,735
Give me a piggyback ride. Let's go. Go.

509
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:52,819
I gotta go change.

510
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,070
Go. Get up.

511
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,489
I got you.

512
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,826
I'm going everywhere you go.

513
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,494
-All right.
-[chuckles]

514
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:05,457
It's gonna be weird,
like, not sleeping together

515
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,792
the next four weeks, basically.

516
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:08,710
I know.

517
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,462
Going from living with

518
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:14,507
no one, to then living
with a guy for the first time,

519
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,302
that's not you, will be definitely
a weird change. [chuckles]

520
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,553
Yes, it will.

521
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,974
I'm also really nervous,
like, living with a girl and, you know.

522
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:27,187
I'm confident that
you'll pick someone that, like,

523
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,981
hopefully gets you to where
you need to be by the end of this.

524
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,277
Hunter wants to move in.
I want to get engaged.

525
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,862
We just can't agree.

526
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,865
I'm getting less out of moving in.

527
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:42,577
I'm gonna cook for you,
clean for you, do your laundry.

528
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,663
And you get all of me. [chuckles]

529
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,458
And so, my thought is,
if you're serious about our relationship,

530
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,543
then put a ring on my finger.

531
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,379
-I love you.
-Hard to say goodbye.

532
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,463
So much.

533
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,049
-I love you.
-I'm gonna miss you. Mmm.

534
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,890
[suspenseful music playing]

535
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,397
[Hunter] <i>There's a part of me</i>
<i>that</i> <i>really struggles</i>

536
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,190
<i>with the concept of an ultimatum.</i>

537
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,442
And so to take such a hard stance

538
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:19,906
and not give sort of any opportunity
for discussion is-- is frustrating.

539
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,827
[Colby] <i>The last thing</i>
<i>I want to say to you before we separate,</i>

540
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:27,414
I just want to make sure
you're getting the full experience.

541
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,582
Like, don't feel like you have to
hold yourself back.

542
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,209
'Cause that's why we're here,

543
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,671
to make sure you're getting,
in the end, exactly what you want.

544
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,673
And to leave with the person you want.

545
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,843
That is the hardest thing for me to say,

546
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,345
but I know it's probably
the best thing for you.

547
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,557
And me, in the end.

548
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,684
I love having you around.

549
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:51,688
I love doing everything I do.
It's better doing it with you.

550
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:57,318
I'm trying to get a picture of my life
without you in it, and that's very hard.

551
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,195
Knowing, like,
we're going to be separated,

552
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,949
I'm extremely scared but extremely happy
you're gonna get to experience that.

553
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,951
Spending this time with somebody else,

554
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:08,788
I think, will really tell you
that I am the one for you.

555
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,627
I know I need to be
ready at the end of this.

556
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:18,089
But that's not something
that I can just push myself into.

557
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:23,428
And it's not something
I'm going to pretend to do if I can't.

558
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,097
It's really scary
because I have to either be there,

559
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,683
or you won't be there.

560
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:33,313
The only thing scarier
than losing you right now

561
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,607
would be to marry you.

562
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,236
[dramatic music playing]

563
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,323
I need that from you.
I need you to be ready.

564
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,409
It's just like really hard

565
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,913
to see how that's gonna happen for me.

566
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,458
If you're not ready by the end of this,

567
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:58,797
it's time for me to take that next step
with someone who's ready for it.

568
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,049
Either that being you if you're ready,

569
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,177
or if that ends up being somebody else,

570
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,972
I need to focus on
who I think will be the best fit for me.

571
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,434
I need to figure out what's best for me.

572
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,562
Who could potentially, you know,

573
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,022
be my lifelong partner,

574
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:19,901
if Madlyn decides that she isn't ready,
because I am there.

575
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,071
And I hope that I'm able to find,
if not here,

576
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:28,243
somebody else out there that's willing
to be with me for the rest of their lives.

577
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,828
Hopefully, end up in marriage.

578
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,916
<i>To Madlyn, um, I love her.</i>

579
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,211

580
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,337
<i>But,</i>

581

um…

582
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,550
Yeah, I'm still going
to pursue other people

583

<i>I came here to do, just for, um--</i>

<i>I don't want to be just--</i>

585
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,517
I don't know.
I'll be heartbroken, though. Ah.

586
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,561
I'm lost right now. I don't know.

587

[tense music playing]

588
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,773

-Hello, hello!
-[Hunter] Well, hi.

-Zay, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you again.

So it's-- it's pretty crazy.

594
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,464
I haven't felt like this

[Madlyn] <i>I'm not ready to get married.</i>

00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,149
I'm gonna enjoy dating other people.
I have one life.

604
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,191
And I'm with somebody

605
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,777
who is going to fully fulfill me
and make me happy forever,

<i>that there's no one out there</i>
<i>better for me?</i>

It's always a question.

[April] <i>I'll give you a hug.</i>

-I just feel like you need a hug.
-Oh, my God.

610
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,831

What's your name again? Zay for Isaiah?

611

-No--
-Don't tell me your name.

-No, my name is Zay. That's it.
-Zay. Got it.

613
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,588

Waking up today as a single woman,
it is weird.

618
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,014
I'm just like, "What is going on?"

<i>In this experience, I'm looking for</i>
<i>the characteristics I want in a husband.</i>

-Like--
-April is a firecracker.

"I'll be a stay-at-home mom.
I can't wait."

631
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:47,090
I want to have kids
later on-- later on, like, when I'm ready.

632
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,883
That's why financial stability is--

633
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,386
-Oh god! Here we go again.
-Know what I'm saying?

634
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:55,348
Let me tell y'all something.
This bitch is financially stable, okay?

635
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,058
I paid for these on my own.

636
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,644
I don't need your wallet.
I can take care of my own ass.

637
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:04,190
I want to continue my career
and get a little bit more established.

638
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,734
I'm not at a place yet
where I'm satisfied.

639
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,113
I need to focus on myself,
as far as, like, financially.

640
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,199
[April] <i>You have the same bullshit-ass</i>
<i>excuse as every other guy.</i>

641

"Next." [chuckles]

-They're Tahitian pearls.

-That's badass. They look really cool.
-Yeah.

644
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,376
Is there a story behind it?

645
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,919
-No, I just got it at the beach.
-No.

646
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:25,837
Okay, I love that.

00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,046
-Great story.
-In Florida.

00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,390
<i>But at the same time,</i>

652
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:40,893
I want to walk out of here engaged
to someone that is ready to get married.

653
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,771
<i>And I hope that it's with Hunter.</i>

654
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,900
But I'm definitely open to the possibility
that I might find someone

655
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,695
that checks all the boxes and is ready.

656
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,740
<i>So I want to grab people's attention,</i>

657
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,784
and I want the guys to see my cute body.

658
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,747
What's most important
for you to find in a-- in a partner?

659
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,124
Sex life is very important for me.

660
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,751
What is a good sex drive to you?

661
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,919
Fucking like, what,
two to three times a day.

662
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,965
I don't think that
that is what I came here to explore.

663
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,842
Why are you looking at me like that?

664
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,510
[Madlyn] Do you have a wild side?

665
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,137
-Of course, I have a wild side.
-Yeah?

666
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,181
-I like sci-fi books.
-Yeah.

667
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,182
[music abruptly stops]

668
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,558
No.

669
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,228
Physical connection
is hard to put in words.

670
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,774
As soon as Randall walked in, I felt it.

671
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,650
-Hey, how's it going?
-[Madlyn chuckles] Hey.

672
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,611
-Take a seat.
-I'm taking off my shorts.

673
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,863
[Madlyn] <i>Randall is very sexy.</i>

674
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,823
Fuck. [chuckles]

675
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:40,620
So to be honest with you,
like, initially, when we came in,

676
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,289
you were like
the first person that I felt like,

677
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,625
that's someone
that I think I could be comfortable.

678
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,169
Your energy is just like--
I feel like it could match.

679
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,504
Yeah. I agree.

680
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,215
Are they on a date,
or are they just talking?

681
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,801
-[Zay] You said what?
-I'll mind my business.

682
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,220
[both chuckling]

683
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,473
-Look, somebody a little jealous already.
-I'm not jealous.

684
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,767
[Shanique] I'm not gonna lie.
It's really weird to see

685
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,269
the person that you came here with
dating someone else,

686
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,271
<i>and, like, laughing</i>
<i>and having a good time.</i>

687
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,233
It's just like, "What is this?" [chuckles]

688
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:15,571
[Madlyn] Marriage is important, so I want
to make sure that when I do go into that,

689
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,697
I am 100% ready.

690
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,534
What are your most
important qualities that you need?

691
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,078
I just need a good listener.
Somebody that, of course,

692
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,747
I want to have fun with,
and just be adventurous with.

693
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,040
-Mm-hmm.
-Um,

694
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,876
and grow old together.
Like, how is everything with you…

695
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,254
-Yeah. Um…
-…and Colby?

696
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:34,048
-Honestly, he's an-- he's an awesome guy.
-Yeah.

697
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,759
-He annoys me. [chuckles] I get annoyed.
-Got you.

698
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,803
You don't have
to speak every five seconds.

699
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,013
-Shut up and let me think for a moment.
-Yeah.

700
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,723
[Madlyn] He's always putting on a show.

701
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,892
It's funny 'cause the things
you love about somebody

702
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,186
can also be the things you end up hating,
like, you--

703
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,813
-Yes.
-You're so bothered by.

704
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,732
Her-- Shanique's friends call her
the next Michelle Obama,

705
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,027
'cause she's always talking,
like, always has an opinion.

706
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,655
You know, Shanique is
a very emotional person,

707
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,867
when it comes down
to the decisions she makes, her feelings.

708
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,745
I just need a good listener.
Somebody that's not so quick to react.

709
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,747
I should expect that from a future wife.

710
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,041
Definitely. Colby is not very realistic.

711
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:14,213
He's very-- He's like,
everything is always perfect, and happy.

712
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,091
And I need him to, like,
take things more seriously

713
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,886
when we're considering
such a serious commitment.

714
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:25,349
I think Colby is definitely scared
to admit that he's excited for this,

715
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,059
because he wants to be the

716
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:31,439
<i>"I'm 100% here for my woman" kind of guy.</i>

717
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:35,151
But there is no way
that Colby is not excited

718
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:41,657
about getting to experience and hang out
with another woman for three weeks.

719
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,825
There's no way.

720
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,703
-[Alexis] Hey, can I come chat?
-Hey, what's up? Yeah.

721
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,997
-How are you? Good.
-Doing good. How are you?

722
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,498
Good. Please, have a seat.

723
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,750
Thanks.

724
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,335
Absolutely. You look great.

725
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,711
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

726
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:54,879
-So do you.
-Thanks.

727
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:00,009
If I had to pick one man here
that's my type, it would be Colby.

728
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,594
Colby gave the ultimatum,

729
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:07,558
and he kind of seems like
this type-A, go-getter, dry personality,

730
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,269
<i>which Hunter is the opposite of that.</i>

731
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,814
It's something that I definitely
came in wanting to figure out, like,

732
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,902
<i>is Hunter the right personality type?</i>
<i>Or is someone else the best fit for me?</i>

733
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,614
Got my nifty little, you know,
towel jacket on to keep me warm.

734
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:24,992
It's nice.
It's like got some fancy vibe going on.

735
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,286
I don't try too hard
when I'm around the pool, but--

736
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,580
It's not a fashion show
when you come out here.

737
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,291
-It's a fashion show for me.
-[chuckles] All right, fair enough.

738
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,710
You're definitely an extrovert.
I got-- I got that vibe.

739
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,254
I mean, I'm in sales, so--

740
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,547
-Yeah, exactly, same here.
-You have to be, yeah.

741
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,465
I want to know,

742
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:43,427
what are you looking to get
out of your potential partner?

743
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,138
Finances are, like,
so important to solidify.

744
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,892
I have a certain lifestyle
that I want to live.

745
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:54,522
Marriage for me is a financial decision
and an emotional decision.

746
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:58,484
If Hunter wasn't making

747
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,697
enough money that was reasonable,
I would walk away.

748
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,824
[chuckles]

749
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,910
I think it's the first time
I've said that out loud.

750
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,288
I don't think Hunter
has ever heard me say that.

751
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,665
People are like,
"You don't need that much money."

752
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,833
I'm like, "No, you do."

753
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,501
I don't ever want to have a situation

754
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,546
where I have to pick,
"I'm paying for this or this."

755
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,841
I don't think I'm the man that
can fulfill the needs she's looking for.

756
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,509
Mm-mm.

757
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,761
-And I-- I grew up comfortable, but--
-Sure.

758
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,264
You know, I would--
I want more than comfortable.

759
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,224
I want, like, good.

760
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,768
To whatever man's out there,
good luck. [chuckles]

761
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,021
[upbeat music playing]

762
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,147
[April] <i>How are you?</i>

763
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,149
-Doing good. How are you?
-Good.

764
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:41,736
So what is going on
with your current relationship

765
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,529
that made you guys wanna come on to here?

766
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,906
-Or whose idea was it?
-It's mine.

767
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,616
No way! It was my idea too!

768
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,078
I know I'm ready.
When I met Madlyn, it was like,

769
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,873
I just knew. Like, I knew immediately.

770
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:54,874
And, um,

771
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:58,002
I want to be able to kind of nurture her,
you know? Like,

772
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,087
give a shoulder to cry on.
She knows it's there.

773
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,798
-She just chooses not to use it, you know?
-Oh!

774
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:06,927
What made me come to this experience
was to make sure she got all her answers.

775
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:10,348
Because if she's not 100% into what I'm--
When I'm 100%,

776
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,141
that's never gonna work out in the end.

777
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:15,102
You have to be on the same page
or you'll never finish the book.

778
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,772
Exactly. It's more so
our backgrounds too.

779
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,358
My parents have been
together for so long.

780
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,152
-You have that role model.
-They're role models, yeah, exactly.

781
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,196
For her, she's just witnessed this

782
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:29,367
nasty divorce that has
recently happened in her life.

783
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,327
-That has really affected…
-It's scary for her.

784
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,330
…and it's scaring her
for that last full commitment of,

785
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,583
"Hey, I'm all in.
Like, you are my partner."

786
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:41,462
"You're my one and only."
That's really, really hard for her.

787
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:45,257
She's just making sure that I am
the one she wants to spend her life with,

788
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,301
and I'm wanting
this experience to show her.

789
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,303
If I'm not, then, hopefully,

790
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,098
somebody here shows her
exactly what she has been looking for.

791
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,517
I hate giving ultimatums, but it's time.

792
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,978
Jake's like, "I need to be
financially stable." That's bullshit.

793
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,648
-That's such bullshit. Yeah.
-It is! Thanks for agreeing.

794
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,275
If a guy's telling me that's bullshit,
like, y'all are bullshit.

795
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,612
-Right.
-I was with Jake when he had military pay.

796
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,697
-Right. Sure.
-I was with him before the money.

797
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,409
Now he's making money, I'm with him.
I'll be with him without it.

798
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,576
Yeah, for sure.

799
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,205
That is just a breath of fresh air,
to talk to a guy

800
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,873
who wants exactly what I want.

801
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:22,503
And Colby and I are on the same page.
So, Colby, cheers to you, my man.

802
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,338
[Colby] So on that note,

803
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,882
-cheers to owning our shit.
-Mm-hmm.

804
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,260
And to hopefully
finding love in the end.

805
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,011
-We will cheers.
-Yes! [chuckles]

806
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:34,140
-To that we will cheers. That's awesome.
-Woo! [chuckles]

807
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,475
I kind of got a little shy around him.

808
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,020
He's the only person that made me shy,
so I don't know if that's good or bad.

809
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,689
-I'm feeling a spark.
-Cheers.

810
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,732
I'm so glad. This is my favorite. I'm--

811
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,650
Give me a hug.

812
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:47,319
[chuckles] I was about to say.
Forget the handshake.

813
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,738
[Colby] <i>April is cool.</i>
<i>She's got the looks.</i>

814
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,824
<i>She has that little kind of quirky vibe.</i>

815
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:55,828
But the spark itself that I'm looking for
hasn't happened yet,

816
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,289
and I'm waiting for that spark to come.

817
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,499
<i>That was the reaction I got with Madlyn,</i>

818
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,460
<i>and I haven't felt that yet.</i>

819
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,170
Will I get it?

820
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,256
I-- I'm gonna give it everything I can.

821
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,009
[upbeat music playing]

822
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,512
[Colby] All right,
maybe you should rock?

823
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,890
-Is it what?
-Is it moving?

824
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,017
-Yeah, it, like, rocks.
-[Colby] Take it easy.

825
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,311
[chuckling]

826
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,146
-How are you?
-Doing good.

827
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,230
-Good.
-Does this work?

828
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,357
You just jump in like that?
Keeping it dry.

829
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,443
I should've took this off
before I sat down.

830
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:31,989
Colby was the first person,
I think, that I was initially drawn to.

831
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,449
I think he is very attractive.

832
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,076
[Lauren] I finally… [chuckles]

833
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,120
…found another guy
who is issuing an ultimatum.

834
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,707
[scoffs] You're the only girl
who hasn't given the ultimatum.

835
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,376
How do you feel about that?

836
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,377
I know.

837
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,546
Everyone here, I feel like,
for the most part,

838
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,298
is, like, very open to having children.

839
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,092
I'm-- I'm the black sheep. [chuckles]

840
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,802
-As a man, I understand.
-Yeah.

841
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,930
I'm not the one
pushing something out of me.

842
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,431
-You know? I gotta be--
-[chuckles]

843
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:01,560
I feel like if the roles were reversed,
I'd have such an easier time with it.

844
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,103
Would you? So is that--?

845
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:07,274
So it's not so much just raising the kid,
it's just having the kid.

846
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,400
Okay. I'll say--

847
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,277
Tell me, I gotta know. What is it?

848
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,280
It's 75%, like, the parenting thing.

849
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:17,159
But 25% of it, I feel like,
is like being pregnant, and--

850
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:22,081
I can see where the scariness of
how having children can be, you know?

851
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,833
I can definitely see it,
and kind of relate to it.

852
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:29,296
But I think that's why you do it
with someone that you love.

853
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,173
[sentimental music playing]

854
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:34,593
Someone that will help you
through those times.

855
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,303
I'm not in this alone.

856
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,931
The kid breaks its arm.
What do we do? Or if it gets…

857
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:39,974
Figure it out together.

858
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,559
…very ill?
You figure it out together,

859
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:46,230
and I think that's what definitely
makes me overcome that fear the most.

860
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:50,192
Yeah. Nathan works a lot.
Nathan is a business owner now.

861
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,695
So are you going to have time?

862
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,238
-That completely make sense.
-Yeah.

863
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:58,701
I really just need to, like,
have those deep conversations,

864
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:01,370
and, like, think about
what parenting looks like one day.

865
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:04,873
And, you know, you have to, like,
figure out a parenting style

866
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,625
-that's gonna work for you.
-For sure.

867
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:10,087
And mom and dad have to be
on the same level of communication, and--

868
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,131
You have to see it
through someone else's eyes,

869
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,882
-especially your partner's eyes…
-Yeah.

870
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,468
…who you're working with,
your teammate, you know.

871
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,762
That's the most
important thing you could possibly do.

872
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:23,142
Colby is definitely
somebody that I find attractive.

873
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:27,187
<i>He has a really sensitive,</i>
<i>emotional side to him.</i>

874
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,274
And it feels like he's listening,

875
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:35,946
and he's hearing what I have to say,
and he wants to see my side of the story,

876
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,157
and it feels really nice.

877
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,409
This is what I need.
I need someone who's sweet.

878
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:44,580
I need someone who's-- who's willing to,
like, be thoughtful.

879
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,874
That's what you're looking
for in a relationship?

880
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,417
Yes. I like that.

881
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,586
I'm-- I'm a family man, simple as that.

882
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:54,882
And so you think it's something that
you could possibly overcome in the future?

883
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,509
Maybe, yeah.

884
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,219
Ultimately, that's why I'm here.

885
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,722
I-- I don't think I would've come here
if I was a hard no.

886
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:06,018
She wants to have kids.
I can tell she wants to have kids.

887
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,813
<i>But Nate works too much.</i>
<i>She mentioned that a couple times,</i>

888
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:14,526
<i>and she's scared that she's gonna</i>
<i>have to be the only one raising the kid.</i>

889
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,946
I feel like I'm a guy who can
comfort those feelings she's having,

890
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,948
and hold her hand
as she goes through them.

891
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,576
[whimsical music playing]

892
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,205
[Jake] <i>So you issued the ultimatum?</i>

893
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,207
I am the one
who issued the ultimatum, yes.

894
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,042
So, I think it's just time.

895
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,878
I've graduated.
I'm trying to settle into a career,

896
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,922
and I just see myself, you know,
being engaged,

897
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,132
and then, you know,
starting a family in a year or two.

898
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,676
Okay. In a year or two. Okay.

899
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,928
Yeah, so how do you feel
being on the flip side?

900
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,721
Being the one who has given the ultimatum.

901
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,724
So I do want everything she wants.

902
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,352
It's just our time-- times
are a little bit different.

903
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,853
April did give me an ultimatum,

904
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,065
<i>but I know that we're gonna</i>
<i>end up together in the long run.</i>

905
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,776
<i>So the game plan</i>
<i>I pretty much have right now is</i>

906
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,738
to show the other women how
a woman's actually supposed to be treated.

907
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,491
What she's mainly worried about
is being a young mom.

908
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,785
I'm like, it's still-- you're still young.

909
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,412
-You don't gotta worry about it.
-Yeah.

910
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,580
I said, like,
low 30s is the-- is the time.

911
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,165
Or maybe even 27?

912
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:14,378
Twenty-seven? [chuckles]
So you really want some kids right now.

913
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,296
-You know, in a couple years.
-Okay.

914
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,174
So looking forward,
what are you looking for?

915
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,134
Like how many kids?

916
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,218
No more than two.

917
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,553
My number is two.

918
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,680
-Two? Okay. So we got that in common.
-Yeah.

919
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:27,266
I don't want any more than two
and I don't want any less.

920
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,476
-Um, I grew up as an only child.
-So did I.

921
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,312
My mom has always wished
she had someone else so I could--

922
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,607
Same. My mom said the same thing.
Like, "I wish I gave you a sibling."

923
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:36,859
My mom is my best friend.

924
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:37,901
My mom is everything.

925
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,486
Yeah, my mom is my literal heart.

926
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,739
People make fun of me,
"You're a mama's boy," I'm like,

927
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,616
"I'm not a mama's boy. It's literally--
I never had a dad in my life."

928
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,953
"If I need anything or to talk
to somebody, I'll call my mom." Yup.

929
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,037
-I'll call my mom.
-Yeah.

930
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,914
You tell her everything, open with her?

931
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,166
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I love that.

932
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,960
She just-- There's no secrets.
Not one thing she doesn't know.

933
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,004
Same. I tell my mom all my business.

934
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,923
My friends are like, "Oh, my God.
You talk to your mom about that?"

935
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,218
"You told her about that party
and that thing?" I'm like, "Yeah."

936
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,261
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

937
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,472
Why-- That's me right there.
That's my best friend.

938
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,223
Growing up, my mom wasn't strict.

939
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,892
-Like, she never grounded me.
-Uh-huh.

940
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,727
-She never disciplined me like that.
-Yeah.

941
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,605
But we had so much love
between each other, I didn't act up.

942
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,816
You didn't wanna do anything to
disappoint her because you loved her.

943
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,777
-I appreciate her.
-That was me with my mom.

944
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,237
-So I never had to sit there and be like--
-[chuckles]

945
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,324
She was never like,
"You're grounded for a week or two weeks."

946
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,159
Do you see yourself
parenting the same way?

947
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:30,245
Because I wanna emulate
the same style my mom did with me.

948
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:33,040
[Jake] 100%. If you could have
your ideal relationship,

949
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,958
-what would it be?
-My ideal relationship?

950
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:38,629
Okay. I think the first word
that comes to mind would just be loyalty.

951
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,881
-That's a big thing.
-That's what I'm looking for.

952
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,842
Did you have problems
with that with Zay or no?

953
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:44,927
Um, I mean--

954
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,888
I just want somebody that I can trust to--

955
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:51,934
Like they go out,
and I'm not at home worried about them.

956
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:55,813
I don't wanna put all this time and work
into this relationship and then it failed.

957
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,523
Not starting over or anything like that.

958
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:01,193
Exactly. That's-- I think that's why
everyone has been struggling,

959
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,654
is because we're all
so afraid of starting over,

960
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,656
and this experience
is making us all start over.

961
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,325
I know. And I'm like,
I don't want to be 50 or 60,

962
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:11,286
look back on my life and say,
"Hey, I should've done this."

963
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,789
-Yeah. Right.
-"I could've experienced this. I didn't."

964
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,499
Yeah. I don't need to be rich.

965
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,543
-I'm not the person that needs to be rich.
-Yeah.

966
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,670
As long as I'm stable
and I can enjoy life.

967
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,047
I feel the same way.
I'm kind of a minimalist, so--

968
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,509
That's funny. You're the first to say it.
I'm very much a minimalist.

969
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:26,552
Really?

970
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,971
I could have my phone,
my clothes, and I'd be happy.

971
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,848
So I'm curious, I kinda have to ask.

972
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,100
What's your background?
What are you mixed with?

973
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,853
I am 25% African. Uh, West African.

974
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:39,314
-Okay.
-So my mom's, um, Italian, so it's crazy.

975
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,899
Yeah, uh, I'm the same way.

976
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,944
My dad is Black.
Like, uh, my family are from Louisiana.

977
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,989
We're Creole, like, Black French.
And then my mom, she's Italian, so--

978
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,157
Okay, so we actually
have that in common too.

979
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,951
We have that in common as well.

980
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,035
-That is crazy.
-So, yeah.

981
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:55,289
I'm worried I'd be awkward
because I haven't had a date in so long.

982
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,000
Me too. You're the most
comfortable person I've talked to so far.

983
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:58,917
Really?

984
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,169
It's very weird, um,
to be dating other women.

985
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,755
<i>My last date</i>
<i>was four or five years ago, and</i>

986
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,259
<i>I definitely love April.</i>
<i>And it's very scary to have</i>

987
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:09,303
<i>this type of connection so quick.</i>

988
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:12,973
<i>But Rae literally hits</i>
<i>every single thing I need in a girl,</i>

989
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,224
<i>plus more.</i>

990
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,685
I think it went pretty damn well.

991
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:19,605
That's so crazy that we have
that much in common. That's crazy.

992
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,190
Crazy. I was not expecting
to have this much in common.

993
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,818
[upbeat music playing]

994
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,281
[Shanique] You wanna get a drink?

995
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:30,657
I did.

996
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,410
-Can I come hang with you guys?
-[Alexis] Yeah, please.

997
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,078
We're blondes in red.

998
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:38,165
I know. We're too red together,
so I'm gonna sit by--

999
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,207
It's true.

1000
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,796
[April] Hi, guys. How's everybody?

1001
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,051
I feel like this first dating session
was practice round.

1002
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:52,137
And I've got a lot of practice in.
I've dated five of y'all.

1003
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,599
<i>And tonight I'm excited to get</i>
<i>to know these guys a little deeper,</i>

1004
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:58,226
and find out who is husband material.

1005
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,770
We're on a mission, girl.

1006
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:03,565
I need to weed out
who is not worth wasting my time,

1007
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,985
and find out who
I am having those connections with.

1008
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:07,945
I am on a mission.

1009
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,991
[Rae] I want to get to know everybody
a bit better and kinda do an icebreaker.

1010
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,327
My first question is for the guys.

1011
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,954
Um, confess or drink.

1012
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:23,293
What guy would you be
most nervous about your ex living with?

1013
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,711
Out of everybody here.

1014
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,796
This guy right here.

1015
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:26,922
-Wow, really?
-Really?

1016
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,049
-'Cause look.
-Oh, same style?

1017
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,051
-We got the same everything.
-Okay. Okay.

1018
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,552
And I gotta say the same.

1019
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,639
Okay. Okay. This is-- this is a good game.

1020
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:39,434
Name your favorite sex position
or take a drink.

1021
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,061
[Alexis] Ooh!

1022
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,690
-I like to hit it from the back.
-[chuckles]

1023
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,692
-Touché. Touché.
-Here we go.

1024
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,944
Colby, you're gonna drink to that or…?

1025
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,904
-I'll drink to that one.
-Okay.

1026
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,864
Because I don't have a favorite, you know.

1027
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,324
Ooh!

1028
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:57,577
What guy has most
of y'all's attention right now?

1029
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,246
Oh, God.

1030
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,331
I would say…

1031
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:02,874
I would say Colby.

1032
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,001
All right.

1033
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:09,006
I have been in a relationship
for two and a half years,

1034
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,550
and haven't been
in the dating scene for a while.

1035
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,302
<i>But I do have my eye on Colby.</i>

1036
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:17,597
<i>And to know the girls here like him,</i>

1037
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,517
I'm definitely feeling
like the pressure is on.

1038
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,477
I'm ready to drink.

1039
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,104
-Oh, take a drink.
-[laughing]

1040
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,897
Okay, okay. All of them drinking?

1041
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:26,982
Randall.

1042
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,859
Randall? Okay.

1043
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,529
Oh, my God. So honest. I love it.

1044
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:37,951
I have not been single probably
since I was 18-- 17, 18 years old.

1045
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,746
I think it's toxic, but I'm excited.

1046
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,998
<i>And it's flattering. It-- it feels good.</i>

1047
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:46,209
<i>My eye's on Randall.</i>
<i>He's the most like me.</i>

1048
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:49,588
<i>He makes me feel comfortable.</i>
<i>I mean, I know it's day one,</i>

1049
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,715
but it's Randall for me right now.

1050
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,508
[laughing] Oh, my God.

1051
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,385
[upbeat music playing]

1052
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:02,392
[laughing]

1053
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,109
-Hello.
-[Colby] Hey.

1054
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,737
I've been waiting to talk to you
one-on-one all night.

1055
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,363
All right. Well, join me.

1056
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,157
-How are you?
-Doing good.

1057
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,909
-Cheers.
-Yeah, cheers.

1058
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,369
-You doing all right? You holding up?
-Mm-hmm.

1059
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,371
Getting your mingle on?

1060
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:26,917
Yeah, it's been fun. That game was
super fun, we need to do more games.

1061
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,502
I love that. I'm all about the games.

1062
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,586
-Really?
-Yeah.

1063
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,465
But I think that icebreaker definitely
helped me understand a little bit more.

1064
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,217
-Yeah.
-Especially knowing

1065
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,512
who thought what
about who they were most interested in…

1066
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,930
-Yeah.
-…and who they weren't.

1067
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,765
What did you think about my answer?

1068
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,185
It surprised me.

1069
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,104
-Really?
-Yeah, it surprised me.

1070
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:48,939
Um--

1071
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,941
[sucks teeth]
Yeah, we had a good discussion.

1072
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:52,734
You know,

1073
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:59,783
I don't think I would see
a future with you in marriage.

1074
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,452
[dramatic music playing]

1075
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:09,000
It's really hard to, like,
go from what we had today to, like--

1076
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:13,880
But I can't-- I can't see a future.

1077
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,927
I didn't get that-- that internal feeling.

1078
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,181
[Alexis]<i> I thought our date went well.</i>

1079
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:27,352
Clearly, it was all lip-service bullshit,

1080
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:33,066
and you just nexted me
as if that was even an option.

1081
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:36,570
Okay.

1082
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,030
[Rae chuckles]

1083
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,908
So how are you feeling about today
after everything?

1084
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,743
Yeah, I'm feeling good.
How are you feeling?

1085
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,412
I'm feeling good. I was like,

1086
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:48,039
"Holy shit, we have a lot in common."
Like, everything.

1087
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,457
-Like, to the T.
-Literally.

1088
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,335
Everything that you were saying,
I was like, "Oh, they found my twin."

1089
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,587
[both laughing]

1090
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,714
I was like,
"This is the girl version of me."

1091
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:59,426
I was like, "Me and April have
a lot in common, but, holy shit."

1092
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:04,306
Like, there's a few things we don't,
and you checked off every single list.

1093
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:07,350
Yeah, I wasn't expecting
for that to happen.

1094
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:11,229
So, yeah, it's just interesting seeing how
everything is going and, like,

1095
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:14,441
you can kind of think you know,
and then you don't really know.

1096
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:15,901
-Exactly, yeah.
-Yeah.

1097
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,361
But you gave the ultimatum, right?

1098
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,279
Yes, I did.

1099
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,740
So you feel a bit better
about this experience or no?

1100
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:24,117
Is it-- is it what you wanted? Or no?

1101
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,620
I don't even know
what I wanted going into this, I think.

1102
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,538
-'Cause I can't read you at all.
-Really?

1103
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,956
-Whatsoever. I'm like…
-No.

1104
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,542
"…Does she-- does she want him?"

1105
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,544
"Does she wanna…?"

1106
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,839
I just want to be happy.
That's what I really, really want.

1107
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:40,175
If I really, like, think about it.
That's all I want.

1108
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,928
-Um, obviously, I would--
-Try to be open to everything.

1109
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,596
-Yeah, I'm trying. I'm trying.
-Okay.

1110
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:47,307
It's a process, you know?
I'm trying to catch on. How about you?

1111
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,976
Do you feel like you're open?
Opening up? Opened up?

1112
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,519
At first, to be honest,

1113
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,189
I didn't come to be open.

1114
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,358
-I'm not the one who gave the ultimatum.
-Right.

1115
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:59,736
So she dragged me on this.
There's something going on, you know?

1116
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,655
So I'm embracing this a little bit more.

1117
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,823
A little more.
The further I get into this, I'm like,

1118
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,326
"Okay, well, we can see." Like you.

1119
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:09,412
Literally, to every T,
I can't say that enough.

1120
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:13,792
But like, everything we talked about,
I was like, "Yup, same."

1121
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:16,962
-"Same. Same. Same."
-Yup, checking my boxes, yeah.

1122
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,172
I hear Jake laughing, and I just was like…

1123
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,260
"Okay, what the hell
could possibly be so funny?"

1124
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,761
-[chuckles]
-[Rae] Kidding.

1125
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:28,473
It's nerve-racking to feel that,
you know, Jake's also single,

1126
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:31,434
and to see him dressed up all nice,

1127
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,687
and I've never seen him
dress this nice before.

1128
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,481
<i>Yeah, I'm a little bit-- I'm</i>
<i>a little bit jealous.</i>

1129
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:40,068
This is a whole different Jake,
and I'm trying to keep my eyes off of him.

1130
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:43,321
I felt comfortable with you right away,
which is always a good sign.

1131
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,282
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1132
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,242
I know exactly what you're talking about.

1133
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:48,410
You get-- you get me.

1134
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:51,579
Do we even have to talk?
We can just look at each other, you know.

1135
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:52,872
-[chuckles]
-[Rae] I'm kidding.

1136
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,749
-This is weird. It's scary, but weird.
-Yeah.

1137
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:58,086
It's a little scary.
It makes me a bit scared, but…

1138
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:00,171
It makes me kinda feel bad,
you know what I mean?

1139
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,882
'Cause I was with this other relationship,
and I'm like--

1140
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:03,883
[Rae] I know.

1141
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:07,637
[Jake] <i>Rae, she's someone</i>
<i>that checks off every single box.</i>

1142
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,389
<i>We connect on every single level.</i>

1143
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,600
It's a little scary how comfortable
we are with each other. Um,

1144
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:16,229
she's the one that gave the ultimatum
and she wants to get married right away.

1145
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,858
<i>I, myself, am not ready</i>
<i>to marry April right now.</i>

1146
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:20,775
But

1147
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:22,861
maybe I can

1148
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,280
change for the right person.

1149
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:27,365
-You wanna sit next to me?
-[Rae] Sure.

1150
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,910
I'm just gonna slide on over.

1151
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,205
[Jake] But, yeah, it's, uh, it's cool.

1152
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,791
-[April] How's everybody?
-[Nate] Can we squeeze in with y'all?

1153
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,461

1154
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,680
